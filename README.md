# Fraud Detection Model

## Overview

This project is a machine learning-based fraud detection system designed to help banking institutions detect fraudulent transactions. The system is built using a neural network model trained on a dataset of credit card transactions. The primary objective is to identify potentially fraudulent transactions based on patterns and behaviors observed in the transaction data.

Fraud detection is critical in the banking sector, as it helps protect both the institution and its customers from financial losses. By deploying this model, banks can enhance their security measures and minimize the risk of fraud.

## How to Use This Project

### Setting Up

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/izzatazfar8/fraud-detection.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd fraud-detection
   ```

3. **Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts ctivate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Training the Model

The model is defined in `fraud_model.py` and can be trained using the following command:

```bash
python model/fraud_model.py
```

This script will load the transaction data, preprocess it, apply a neural network model, and train it to detect fraudulent transactions.

### Running Tests

Tests are located in the `test/` directory and can be run using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest test/
```

These tests ensure the model's robustness, reliability, and accuracy.

## Project Purpose in a Banking Department

### Fraud Detection

The primary purpose of this project is to detect fraudulent transactions within a banking environment. Fraud detection models are essential in preventing financial losses and protecting customers' accounts from unauthorized activities. This model can be integrated into a bank's transaction processing system, where it will flag suspicious transactions for further investigation.

### Risk Management

By implementing this model, banks can proactively manage risks associated with fraudulent activities. The model's ability to accurately detect fraud reduces the likelihood of false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraudulent) and false negatives (fraudulent transactions not flagged), thereby enhancing the overall security and trustworthiness of the banking system.

## Purpose of Each Test Script

### `test_functionality.py`
- **Purpose**: Ensures the basic functionality of the model. This test checks that the model’s predictions are within the expected range (i.e., between 0 and 1). This is crucial for ensuring the model behaves as expected during deployment.

### `test_integration.py`
- **Purpose**: Verifies that the model integrates correctly with other components and is configured properly. This test is essential for ensuring the model works seamlessly within the broader banking system.

### `test_performance.py`
- **Purpose**: Tests the performance of the model by checking the number of parameters and ensuring the model is not excessively large. This ensures the model is efficient and can run in environments with limited resources, such as on-premises banking servers.

### `test_reliability.py`
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the model produces consistent results when given the same input multiple times. This test is vital in a banking context, where consistent behavior is crucial for trust and reliability.

### `test_regression.py`
- **Purpose**: Prevents regression by comparing the current model’s output to previous versions. This ensures that updates or modifications to the model do not degrade its performance, maintaining a high standard of fraud detection.

### `test_model_accuracy.py`
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the model's accuracy on a test set to ensure it meets the required performance standards. High accuracy is critical in a banking environment to minimize the number of false positives and negatives.

### `test_data_loading.py`
- **Purpose**: Tests the data loading process to ensure the integrity and correctness of the data being fed into the model. Accurate data loading is crucial for maintaining the reliability of the fraud detection process.

### `test_negative.py`
- **Purpose**: Tests how the model handles unexpected or edge-case inputs, such as negative values or corrupted data. This helps ensure the model is robust and can handle real-world anomalies without crashing or producing incorrect results.

### `test_unit.py`
- **Purpose**: Conducts unit tests on individual components of the model, such as specific layers or functions. This is important for isolating issues and ensuring that each part of the model functions correctly.

### `test_underfitting_overfitting.py`
- **Purpose**: Checks for signs of underfitting (where the model fails to learn from the training data) and overfitting (where the model performs well on training data but poorly on new data). This test ensures the model is well-balanced and generalizes effectively to new transactions.

### `test_security.py`
- **Purpose**: Tests the model's robustness against malicious inputs or attacks. This is particularly important in a banking environment where adversarial attacks could attempt to manipulate the model to allow fraudulent transactions to pass undetected.

## Managing Large Files

### Using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)

If your project includes large files, such as datasets or binary files, that exceed GitHub's size limits, you should use Git LFS to manage them.

1. **Install Git LFS**:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

2. **Track the Large Files**:
   ```bash
   git lfs track "*.csv"
   git lfs track "*.dll"
   git lfs track "*.pyd"
   ```

3. **Commit and Push**:
   ```bash
   git add .gitattributes
   git add data/creditcard.csv
   git commit -m "Track large files using Git LFS"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Cleaning the Repository

If you've already committed large files and need to remove them from the repository's history, you can use `git filter-repo`.

### Removing Large Files with `git filter-repo`

1. **Install `git filter-repo`**:
   ```bash
   pip install git-filter-repo
   ```

2. **Run `git filter-repo`**:
   ```bash
   git filter-repo --path venv/Lib/site-packages/tensorflow/python/_pywrap_tensorflow_internal.pyd --path data/creditcard.csv --path venv/Lib/site-packages/clang/native/libclang.dll --invert-paths --force
   ```

3. **Clean Up the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   ```

4. **Force Push the Cleaned History**:
   ```bash
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

## Conclusion

This fraud detection model is designed to be an integral part of a bank's security and risk management strategy. By implementing this model and running the accompanying tests, banks can enhance their ability to detect and prevent fraudulent activities, thereby protecting their assets and maintaining the trust of their customers.
